# Slog

Used to scan logs for key words/phrases/regexs and get a corresponding timestamp. The graph the counts (per second?)
of the various results. Example use is we know the log files contain XXX and also YYY but want to get an idea of does a
spike in XXX happen before every YYY etc. Using this hopefully it will become easier to see these correlations in a
graph.

Well... that's the plan.....
